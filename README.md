# mean-covariance-project
This notebook was a part of a project for a mathematics course I'm taking at 
the time of this writing (https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning). 
It serves as a demonstration showing how to apply the mean and co-variance to a dataset, 
and its effects on a linear transormation.
